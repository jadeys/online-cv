        I worked for a year in Delft University of Technology at the last stage of my PhD period. In this year, I mainly study
        the fingerprint approach aiming to produce geocenter motion and changes in the Earth's oblateness time series. Such a
        method is useful in that it not only provide accurate estimates but also allow a direct explaination of the mechanism.

        For my PhD, I mainy estimate geocenter motion and the Earth's dynamic oblateness time-series using GRACE data and geophysical models.
        I have improved and extended a method put forward by Swenson et al., (2008) and now my work is the offical reference for the updated
        geocenter motion data available on the GRACE TELLUS website (https://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/data/get-data/geocenter).
